      body: >-
        At County Line Construction, we understand that some homeowners in the
        Gig Harbor area have to work with over-priced excavation contractors
        that lack business integrity. They fail to understand the real problem
        at hand or meet set deadlines.


        That’s why we built an excavation company that goes beyond dirt work. We
        solve real problems to help you make your vision become a reality. Give
        us a call, and we’ll help you navigate your first steps in the
        excavation and grading process with a free consultation.

      body: "With experience in a wide array of construction scenarios, we understand that subcontractors can make the construction process harder than it needs to be. Sometimes an excavation operator’s skills are subpar;\_ at other times, the excavation company has a “get-in-get-out” mentality with little regard for customers, state regulations, timelines, and clean-up.\n\nThat’s why we built an excavation company with integrity, where we see you as a business partner and your customer as our customer. An excavation partner with skilled operators, responsive customer service, and top-notch professionalism. That’s County Line Excavation."

      body: >-
        Drainage issues are a common problem in the Northwest, and it can be
        stressful to find out that the longevity of an investment is in
        jeopardy. With little to no construction experience, many homeowners
        find it difficult to assess a drainage specialist’s ability to locate
        the root cause of a problem and provide a solution in a timely manner.


        That’s why we founded County Line Excavation, to provide a responsive
        resource with actionable advice, and construction know-how so that you
        can save your property before it’s too late. Give us a call and we’ll
        give you actionable advice on how to fix your drainage issue.
