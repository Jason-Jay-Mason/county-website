  body: "Several years ago, my wife and I decided to build our dream home. After we bought our land, we knew exactly what we wanted to build, and for us, it took some work to ensure that the construction was completed on time and under budget. Of course,when it came to the excavation, I was set on doing it myself because I had both the expertise and vision to make it happen.\_\n\nHiring and managing subcontractors for the project wasn’t easy, but my years of experience and construction knowledge enabled me to select the best contractors. In October of 2014 we completed construction.\_ The feeling of seeing our vision become a reality was truly\_ special.\n\nI want my customers to experience the same satisfaction we felt when we finished our dream home just the way we envisioned. Unfortunately, I know that most homeowners out there don’t have a construction background\_ and are at risk of being taken advantage of.\n\nThat’s why we’re dedicated to going beyond dirt work,\_ solving real problems,\_ and helping you see your vision become a reality—all the while maintaining the highest level of integrity at a price you can afford."

      headline: We focus on solutions
      body: >-
        Many excavating contractors in the industry are able to operate an
        excavator, but when it comes to real problem-solving, many fall short.
        That's why we work to address the heart of the problem at hand.

      headline: We take pride in quality
      body: >-
        Sometimes it's easy to think that quality work in the construction
        industry is a lost art. At County Line, we take pride in our dirt work.
        That means no cutting corners for selfish gain. We give our customers
        our best every time.

      headline: We aim to educate
      body: >-
        Many homeowners are not familiar with the construction process as a
        whole. This can put them in a tight spot when assessing  an excavation
        operator’s skill. That's why we value education. We encourage customers
        to use us as a resource to gain the knowledge they need to manage their
        projects successfully.
