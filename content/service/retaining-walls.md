      headline: Competitive Pricing
      body: >-
        We've noticed that when our customers receive bids from other
        contractors, the estimated cost for the same work can vary widely. This
        leaves people in a hard spot where it is difficult to know which bid to
        trust. That's why we aim for pricing that is competitive but at the same
        time, realistic.
