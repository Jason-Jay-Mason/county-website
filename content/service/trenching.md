      headline: Quality & safety
      body: >-
        Trenching is notoriously dangerous, and that's why our number one
        priority with utility and trenching work is to ensure the other
        subcontractors on site are safe. It is standard practice for us to apply
        sloping, benching, trench shields, and shoring where applicable and to
        locate current utility lines before digging.

        We understand dirt work is one piece in the construction process puzzle.
        Missed deadlines have a significant impact on a project or repair.
        That's why we make sure to respect each customer's time and remain
        responsive to their specific deadlines.
