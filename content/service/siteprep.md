      body: >-
        If your looking to get started on the construction of a new and
        undeveloped property, clearing and grading are essential. We've cleared
        properties ranging from small to large in the Puget Sound area. That
        means trees, brush, rocks, and everything in-between. When you choose
        County Line for your site preparation, you'll be left with a perfect
        site to build on.
