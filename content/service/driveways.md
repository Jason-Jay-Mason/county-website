        Gravel road construction begins with an assessment of the environmental
        factors at the job site, including drainage and soil conditions. Once a
        construction plan is agreed upon, we begin the clearing and grading
        processes where the base path is built. Finally, we lay down the layers
        of the road that will provide the best longevity for your specific area.

        Gravel driveway potholes can become annoying. Many people try to remedy
        the situation by either DIYing the repair or hiring an inexperienced and
        underpriced contractor. Unfortunately, many times these homeowners are
        disappointed to see that their repairs were not a long-term solution. 
        We're here to help. We have the equipment and know-how to provide
        repairs that make for lasting driveways.

      headline: Competitive pricing
      body: >-
        We've noticed that when our customers receive bids from other
        contractors, the estimated cost for the same work can vary widely. This
        leaves people in a tough spot where it's hard to know which bid to
        trust. That's why we aim for pricing that is competitive but at the same
        time, realistic.
