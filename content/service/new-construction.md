      headline: Competitive pricing
      body: >-
        We've noticed that when our customers receive bids from other
        contractors, the estimated cost for the same work can vary widely. This
        leaves people in a tough spot where it becomes difficult to know which
        bid to trust. That's why we aim for pricing that is competitive but at
        the same time, realistic.
