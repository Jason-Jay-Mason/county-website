We are finally reclaiming our property from the berries and brush after the mulching that they did. Marcus wasn't done until we were 100% satisfied. They will be doing more work for us. Highly recommend."

I've dealt with around 15 contractors, and Marcus is one of the very few that actually cares about his customers and his quality of work. Marcus has gone above and beyond multiple times, and if any issues come up, he makes sure it gets fixed in a way that works for everyone. He has repeatedly helped fix issues caused by other contractors. He is a great guy that does great work. I'm super lucky to have found him to help with our house build."

Other companies only offered to haul it off or only chip a few piles and at a higher cost. Marcus was friendly, professional, transparent about pricing, and very skilled with the mulcher. The yard is transformed thanks to Marcus and County Line Construction!",

Marcus of County Line Construction was recommended to us by a neighbor and I am glad they did! He came out to take a look the space and put a very reasonable bid together for us. He put us on his schedule and was actually able to finish the job early. Marcus was great to work with. He communicated with us throughout the entire process, was on time and we are extremely happy with the work. We will be recommending County Line to the rest of our neighbors!",
